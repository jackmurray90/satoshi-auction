<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>Satoshi Auction is a form of penny-auction.</p>

<p>In a penny auction, each bid is paid for in advance, and there are no returns.</p>

<p>The prize starts off as 10k satoshis.</p>

<p>Anybody can make a bid for the prize, at any time.</p>

<p>98% of each bid is added to the prize.</p>

<p>The auction ends when 144 bitcoin blocks have passed without a bid. This will take appoximately one day.</p>

<p>The participant who has made the maximum bid wins the prize.</p>

<p>In the case of a tie, funds are distributed equally to the winning bidders and any fractional remainder is left with the host.</p>

<p>Bids that are received after the end of an auction are sent back to the address that sent them, minus an 0.0001 BTC transaction fee.</p>
